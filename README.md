# Mouse Jiggler
This repository holds the code for a mouse jiggler application. This application will automate the movement of your mouse.

If you like the code or would like to reach out to me about potential updates / features you can find me on twitter @DevDenzo

# Modes
This application has 4 different modes:

1. Random Line Mode - moves the mouse in a line from one point to another
2. Random Point Mode - teleports the mouse from one point to another
3. Pattern Mode - moves the mouse in a zig zag pattern across your screen or screens
4. Human Mode (Coming Soon) - will move the mouse in similar ways common applicatins are used.

# How to run the code

Must have Python installed on their computers. You will also need to pip install all the required modules and libraries. 

Once you have installed them, you can simply run the app.py file and this will run the application in your terminal. You can then follow the instructions that appear onscreen.

You must push and hold your selections. Tapping the button will not register your selection. Please allow for time for some of the modes to generate a long list of random coordinates to move the mouse to.
